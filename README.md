# CT-MyFirstRepo
this is where I will write down my Coding Temple journey thus far
This journey has been great. I've learned a lot of new material in a short amount of time. Learning the command terminal has been my favorite so far. I expect to enjoy learning Python a lot just because I've heard such good things about it. Codewars is a really cool concept as well. I believe in practice makes perfect and that's what Codewars is. The goal of 400 honor seems like a long ways away but I will be tackling some of those 8-7 kyu (for now) problems consistently.
